First, I created a GitHub repository and cloned it into my Workspace. 
Then, I created two branches from the main branch header and footer. 
I added some navigation bar sections and footers to these branches. 
Next, I merged them into the main branch. However, there was a conflict regarding the navigation bar. 
I chose both codes because I needed both of them to add a few sections from the footer. 
After pushing the changes to the remote repository, everything worked perfectly.

I went to GitHub and reviewed the changes. 
Everything was there, so I created a pull request. 
I went through the pull request process and made two pull requests. 
Both of them worked perfectly.
