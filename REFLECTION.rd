First I created a github repository and i cloned the repository in my Workspace, 
and then I created 2 branches from the main branch header and footer added some navigation bar section and footer 
and then I merge them into the main branch, it was a conflit about navigation bar, 
I choose both codes because i was need both of them to added some few section from footer, and afther I push to the remote repository, it was working perfertilly.
I went to Github and review it, very things was theer, and then I created a pull resquest and 
i went throught the pull resquest process and i made 2 pull resquests, it was working perfertilly
